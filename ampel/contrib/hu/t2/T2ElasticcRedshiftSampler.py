class T2ElasticcRedshiftSampler(AbsPointT2Unit):
    """
    Parse the elasticc diaSource host information and
    returns a list of redshifts and weights.

    Note 1:
    Elasticc alerts contain both quantiles and mean value + error.
    According to information late May (Kessler), uncertainties will likely
    be normal, meaning that there will be no additional information in the
    quantiles. But they _might_ change this.
    Update from Rob June 10th: They will _likely_ change this.

    Note 2:
    Elasticc training lightcurves do not seem to consistently have any photo-z
    sort_values, but rather an encoding as "REDSHIFT_FINAL(_ERR)".
    This might change with the test stream, but there could also be hostless sne.

    Note 3:
    Values for two potential host galaxies are provided. Entries such as
    e.g. 'HOSTGAL2_SNSEP' allows to calculate the probability. Again,
    this information not regularly provided. We can calculate this here,
    and still provide a combined set of redshifts with probabilities weighted
    for the two possible goals.

    Host galaxy properties (mass, sfr) also provided. We could use this to also
    provide constraints on the potential types. This can be saved into the T2Doc
    and considered in the T3.

    Update June 14:
    From ghost https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abd02b/pdf
    we take it that the first order solution is to take the galaxy with the smallest
    DDLR.

    Note 4:
    The default setting for normal error distribution will be to use
    [-1.5 sig, 0, 1.5 sig] with relative weights [0.19684199, 0.60631602, 0.19684199]
